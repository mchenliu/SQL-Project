# Introduction
This project focuses on exploring jobs in data analytics. Including revealing top-paying jobs, highly-demanded skills and what skills pays the most. My initial intention was to focus on the New Zealand and Australia market but due to data collection limitation, this project will explore all job postings.

# Background
This project is created under the guidance of Luke Barousse's [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). The goal of this project is to demontrate my understanding of SQL. 

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I used
Key tools used in this project are:

- **SQL**: This is the core of the project. Used to query database and capture crucial insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: One of the most popular database management systems.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Recommended by the course. Ideal for executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential platform for sharing SQL scripts and analysis.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed to answer specific question of the data analyst job market. Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To find out the highest-paying positions, I filtered out data analyst positions by average annual salary in all locations. This query highlights the high paying jobs on market.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim
ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    -- job_location = 'New Zealand' OR
    -- job_location = 'Australia' AND
    salary_year_avg is NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 50;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Top Job Titles**: The most frequently listed job titles for data analyst roles include a mix of generic "Data Analyst" roles, as well as specialized positions like "Senior Data Analyst" and "Database Administrator." This suggests that thereâ€™s demand for both entry-level and experienced data analysts with specific skill sets.
- **Salary Distribution**: The average annual salary for these roles varies, with a concentration around certain salary bands, suggesting typical pay ranges for data analyst positions.
- **Popular Job Locations**: The data shows the most common locations for these roles, which include major cities or regions with a strong tech and business presence.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Roles
This query finds what skills are required for top-paying positions. Job postings data was joined with skills data to highlight what employers are looking for in high-paid positions.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS(
    SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        -- job_location = 'New Zealand' OR
        -- job_location = 'Australia' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim
ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;

```

Here's the breakdown of the most in demand skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **SQL** is the most mentioned skill leading with 8 occurrences.
- **Python** follows with 7 occurrences.
- **Tableau** follows closely with 6 occurrences.
Other skills including **R**(4 occurrences), **Snowflake**(3 occurrences), **Pandas**(3 occurrences) and **Excel**(3 occurrences) are also highly preferred.
